This is a remote repository for all my CS430 homework, projects, and other associated files. This repository contains my solutions for each of the given assignments. View at your own discretion as answers/solutions may not be correct.

## Running Python Code on UNIX

In the directory where the python script lies, you can run the following command to run the code.

```console
python3 samplePythonAndSQL.py
```

## Running Java Code on UNIX

Run the given jar file which contains the files needed to compile and run the programs.

```console
export CLASSPATH=/home/yourPath/ojdbc11.jar
```

Where `/home/yourPath` is replaced by the full path of the directory where `ojdbc11.jar` lies.

Use `cd` to go to the folder where the java code lies.

You must compile the java files before running them.

```console
javac P1.java
```

Then you can run the java file.

```console
java P1.java
```
